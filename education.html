					<h2>What should I write about?</h2>
					<p>
					What should I write about?
					Here is a painful shout.
					The truth is getting the insult
					And the beauty forgets to get absurd.
					I am feeling shy to be here.
					My heart is holding a gift without care.
					I call you and you are absent
					Our love is crazy to be great.
					There is the emptiness of knowledge
					Ignorance is taking the advantage.
					I am just observing everything
					With the brain of flower plucking.
					No hope and no depression is here
					With only the greatest surrender
					Let us be the fresher again
					To say only the creation needs to regain.
