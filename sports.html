					<h2>Tamim ton streets Comilla to huge total</h2>
					<p>Tamim Iqbal played an explosive innings of unbeaten 141 runs to pile up a daunting total of 199/3 against Dhaka Dynamites in the final match of the sixth Bangladesh Premier League at Sher-e Bangla National Stadium on Friday.

					Tamim unfurled his array of strokes and clubbed Dhaka bowlers to all over the ground and made 141 off just 61 balls with 10 fours and 11 sixes.

					The southpaw opener reached his hundred off just 50 balls in 17th over bowled by Dhaka’s West Indian recruit Andre Russell. Russell conceded 22 runs in the hand of Tamim in that over.

					Comilla lost the wicket of Evin Lewis on just 9 runs on board, but Tamim, along with Anamul added 89 runs in second wicket partnership. Anamul departed for 24 off 30 balls. </p>

					<p>West Indies have finally managed to win a trophy at the end of their three-month long sub-continental tour beating Bangladesh by a big margin of 50 runs in the 3rd T20I at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Saturday, reports UNB.

					Bangladesh won the Test and ODI series, but they failed to repeat the same act in the three-match T20I series. In the series decider, Bangladeshi batsmen were clueless to make a strong reply to 190 of West Indies.

					Evin Lewis hit 89 of 39 balls which proved to be the series-deciding performance. Keemo Paul, the spearhead of West Indies, took five wickets for the first time in T20Is to tumble the Tigers.</p>

					<h2>Dhaka will be thinking of us a lot more, says Imrul</h2>
					<p><b>Imrul Kayes has led his side Comilla Victorians to the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) final with well-balanced side. Asked where his side has the advantage, he reiterated that Dhaka Dynamites will be the side who will think a lot about Comilla than the other way around. And that will mean that his side will have the mental edge when the two sides meet in the final tomorrow.</b></p>
					<p>Vicorians won by narrow margins in both of their matches against Dhaka so far in the tournament. All-rounders Thisara Perera was the hero in the first match while the second one – a tight encounter that finished with a one-run victory for Comilla -- saw Mohammad Saifuddin emerge as the hero.</p>

					West Indies recalled veteran batsman Chris Gayle on Thursday for the first two one-day internationals against England in preparation for this year's World Cup.

						The hard-hitting, 39-year-old Gayle last played for West Indies during a home series against Bangladesh last July, and could renew an explosive opening partnership alongside Evin Lewis.

						Lewis and Gayle both missed the recent ODI series in India and Bangladesh but have been included as part of a 14-man squad that saw left-handed batsman Nicholas Pooran called up for the first time.

						West Indies and England will contest five one-dayers following the conclusion of the Test series, in which the hosts hold an unassailable 2-0 lead ahead of the finale in St Lucia on Saturday.
