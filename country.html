					<h2>One tough year</h2>
					<p>BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia has been in jail for a year and the party is “facing the most difficult time in its history” in her absence.

					The party has failed to reorganise following its defeat in the December 30 general polls. Its leaders and activists have been demoralised and there are no fresh protests to boost their morale. 

					To add to their woes, many senior leaders have become inactive after the election fearing harassment, said party sources.</p>

					<h2>HC Bench on 3 Petitions: Khaleda expresses no confidence</h2>
					<p>BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia yesterday expressed no confidence in the High Court bench of Justice JBM Hassan assigned by the chief justice to dispose of the three writ petitions regarding cancellation of her nomination papers.

						During the court proceedings, AJ Mohammad Ali, the principal counsel for Khaleda, said she has no confidence in this bench as Justice JBM Hassan is junior to Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, who presided over a two-judge HC bench that passed dissenting orders on the BNP chief's petitions.

						Justice Hassan told the lawyer that Chief Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain assigned his bench to hold hearing on the petitions.

						Ali said that traditionally, a senior judge should hear and dispose of any petition on which another bench passed dissenting orders.</p>

					<h2>Modi assures India’s cooperation in resolving Rohingya crisis</h2>
					<p>Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on Thursday assured New Delhi’s cooperation in resolving the longstanding Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh.
					His assurance came when visiting Bangladesh foreign minister AK Abdul Momen sought India’s support for early repatriation of Rohingya people to Myanmar’s Rakhine state as he met the Indian prime minister in New Delhi in the morning.
					As Momen thanked prime minister Modi for India’s humanitarian assistance to Rohingyas, the PM said that India was always with Bangladesh and would remain beside it, a press release issued by Bangladesh mission in India said.
					During the meeting, the Indian prime minister mentioned that the partnership between Bangladesh and India was flourishing under the visionary leadership of prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
					He reaffirmed India’s sincere commitment to Bangladesh’s prosperity and development and viewed that Bangladesh-India relations was a model between the two neighbouring countries which needed to be showcased for wider audience around the world.
					The foreign minister expressed his satisfaction on the excellent bilateral relations that exist between the two countries which had grown and prospered, especially with the statesmanship of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and prime minister Modi.
					He stressed that Bangladesh would continue her resolve in further strengthening and deepening her relations with India in the coming days.</p>
